# Bank account project. 

- This program will have two superclasses and the CheckingAccount class will inherit from BankAccount. 
- The superclasses will both contain constructors and the BankAccount class will have methods that deposit, withdraw, summary, along with getters/setters.

- The CheckingAccount class will allow the user to overdraft with a $30 fee.

- Lastly, there will be a test class that will test these two programs.
